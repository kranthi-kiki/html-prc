                    For some people, the word "nerd" might bring to mind images of a skinny teenage boy 
                    with braces and Coke-bottle glasses. The nerd was once a specific brand of social outcast:
                     one who never talked to girls, did well in science class, and read comic books religiously. 
                     Well, I have news for you: the nerd is no more. Outcast boys have learned that there are also outcast girls, 
                     that being good at science is no longer something to be embarrassed about, and that reading comic books 
                     is something everyone can enjoy.

                    Still, not everyone has hopped on the comic book and graphic novel train. 
                    Some people don't take comic books as seriously as they take other books, 
                    and most people don't realize the benefits of reading these visual masterpieces. 
                    So, what are some of the benefits of reading comic books?
